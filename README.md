## Getting and Cleaning Data Project

* Olmer Nunez-Sosa
* Date: 2016/02/28
* Repo for the submission of the course project for the John Hopkins Getting and Cleanning Data course

### Overview
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
[The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
                                       
Here are the data for the project:

### Information available in this Github 
In this Github you will find:
* 1. Links from the data and its descriptions.
* 2. The Script to get and clean the data to obtain a tiny data.
* 3. The CodeBook that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up. 
* 4. The tiny data in txt format.

### Project summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
* 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
* 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  

### Additional Information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.

Carefull with 14 line; there you should set your own working directory.
